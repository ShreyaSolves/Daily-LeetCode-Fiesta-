# 🧩 Daily LeetCode Challenge: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Welcome to **Day 3** of my coding fiesta! ✨ Today’s challenge is the **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number** (Medium) from LeetCode. This problem turns a set of digits into every possible letter combination, just like mixing tracks into the perfect playlist. 🎶

---

## 📌 Problem Overview
We’re given a string of digits (`2–9`) and asked to generate all possible letter combinations based on the classic phone keypad mapping.

- Example: `"23"` → `["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]`
- Special case: empty string → return `[]`
- Each digit corresponds to certain letters (e.g., 2 → `abc`, 3 → `def`).

## ✨ Key Insights
- **Constraints**:  
  - Digits length: 2–4 (short and sweet)  
  - Only digits 2–9 are valid  
  - Output can be in any order  

- **Why it’s fun**:  
  This problem is essentially a **combinatorial explosion** challenge, but on a small and manageable scale. Think of it like choreographing dance moves—one step per digit until you’ve got a full routine!

## 🛠️ Approach (Backtracking Magic)
The best way to solve this is with **backtracking**:
1. Start with an empty string.  
2. For each digit, branch out with all possible letters.  
3. Continue until you’ve assigned letters for all digits.  
4. Collect the results and you’ve got your playlist of combos!  

This method ensures we explore all possibilities efficiently while keeping the logic clean.

## 💭 Reflections
Day 3 felt like a smooth groove—backtracking is creative, logical, and super satisfying when it clicks. It’s like assembling a word-smoothie with the perfect ingredients. Excited to keep this streak rolling for Day 4! 🚀
