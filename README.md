# Daily LeetCode Fiesta! 🌟  

Welcome to the **Daily LeetCode Fiesta**—a space to build consistency, flex problem-solving muscles, and keep the coding party alive. 🎉  
The idea is simple: one LeetCode puzzle, one solution, every single day.  

---

## 📌 What’s Inside  
Each daily folder (named **YYYY-MM-DD**) includes:  
- **`problem.md`** → Problem statement + key notes.  
- **`solution.py`** → Python solution with explanations.  
- **`readme.md`** *(sometimes)* → Extra reflections or insights.  

---
## 🎯 Example Sneak Peek  

**2025-08-25**  
- **Problem:** *Diagonal Traverse (Medium)* → a zig-zag ride through a matrix.  
- **Solution:** `solution.py`  
- **Reflection:** Cracked it with a fun direction-switching trick—super satisfying!

## 💡 Why This Exists  
This fiesta is all about:  
- Staying consistent with coding practice.  
- Sharpening algorithms & problem-solving skills.  
- Documenting growth and sharing learnings with others.
